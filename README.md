# xpra-cloud-apps
A sandbox configuration for running apps inside a browser window using XPRA.

## Introduction

This is a quick test of [XPRA](https://xpra.org) 

### Applications:

* VSCODE
* ANDROID STUDIO/IntelliJ

Mainly I wanted to be able to run these apps from the Cloud rather than my Pixelbook so I use docker and X11 to achieve that. However, there was a requirement to run apps within the browser. XPRA works really well and means I dont have to use a VNC plugin.
